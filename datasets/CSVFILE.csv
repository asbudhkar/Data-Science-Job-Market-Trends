Would you like to help us build the next-generation cloud services that will power the largest managed infrastructure in the world? We’re hiring a Data Scientist for AWS Compute Optimizer team within Amazon AWS EC2. Our service uses large amounts of data combined with machine learning (ML) and push the boundaries of scale, availability, and performance, while maintaining the highest standards for security and operational excellence.

AWS Compute Optimizer helps you choose optimal configurations for three types of AWS resources: Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and AWS Lambda functions, based on your utilization data. By applying the knowledge drawn from Amazon’s own experience running diverse workloads in the cloud, Compute Optimizer identifies workload patterns and recommends optimal AWS resources. Compute Optimizer analyzes the configuration and resource utilization of your workload to identify dozens of defining characteristics, for example, if a workload is CPU-intensive, if it exhibits a daily pattern, or if a workload accesses local storage frequently. The service processes these characteristics and identifies the hardware resource required by the workload. Compute Optimizer infers how the workload would have performed on various hardware platforms (e.g. Amazon EC2 instances types) or using different configurations (e.g. Amazon EBS volume IOPS settings, and AWS Lambda function memory sizes) to offer recommendations.

You will take on challenges in providing recommendations based on billions of metric records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems.

Position Responsibilities

Build statistical and ML recommendation models
Drive collaborative research and creative problem solving across science and engineering team
Analyze complex datasets to drive insight
Propose and validate hypothesis to deliver and direct our product road map
Work with engineers to deliver low latency model predictions to production

2804910174,Data Scientist,IDEO,2021-11-19,United States,"Cambridge, MA",Engineering and Information Technology,Full-time,"Marketing and Advertising, Computer Software, and Internet Publishing","Please apply with a resume and cover letter by November 26, 2021. We will be reviewing applications on a rolling basis after the application deadline.

In a Nutshell

IDEO’s Research and Insights practice is in search of a Data Scientist who is well-versed in leveraging data science methods to improve understanding and aid in discovery. This person will be a member of our client-facing design teams that inform design, innovation, and strategy across a broad spectrum of projects and help to advance our practice in new approaches to understanding complex problems. This position shares much in common with our recently posted Computational Social Scientist / Data Scientists positions but is open to a wider array of fields outside of the social sciences.

Why is this role important for IDEO’s work?

An IDEO Data Scientist makes the biggest impact by seamlessly integrating data-enabled research methods into the wider design process. This person is able to seek out, explore, and analyze existing data sets, as well as create new ones, to generate insights for design.

They are responsible for structuring human-centered research and leading multidisciplinary internal and client teams through developing quantitative research activities and tools (algorithm based, sensor based, or whatever best captures the need), communicating complex technical concepts and results with clients and teams, discovering and leveraging novel public data sources, leveraging new data science methods and tools, and otherwise finding smart ways to augment qualitative research processes and insights with those that are data-enabled.

Experience and confidence working in interdisciplinary teams and a demonstrated ability to establish empathy with participants in a variety of contexts is advantageous.

We don’t expect all candidates to have deep experience in every aspect of what’s described below, but rather look to build a team that holds strength in all of these areas. So, if you are not sure if this is a good fit, please apply and we’d be excited to learn more about your experience!

Once Here You Will

Center your work on people. We go to work because we want to improve peoples’ lives through design. You’ll talk with and design alongside the people our designs affect, to develop a deep understanding of their needs and their context and develop solutions.
Partner with our clients. It doesn’t matter how smart or creative our work is if it isn’t viable for our client’s business. You’ll get to know our clients’ values, strategy, and structure so that you can be an effective partner and make things happen.
Create tangible things, quickly. One of our values is “talk less, do more” and our work often requires quick iteration over perfection. You’ll perform data analysis, create visualizations/simulations, and implement statistical/machine learning/optimization algorithms — learning new techniques and tools as necessary.
Shape data science at IDEO (and beyond!). We believe that we have an opportunity to help conceive of a new way of practicing data science that improves business and society. You’ll explore approaches to practicing data science and share stories inside and outside of IDEO of what you’ve learned along the way.
Collaborate with inspiring colleagues. We’re a passionate and creative community from a variety of backgrounds: anthropology, software development, graphic design, management, journalism, architecture, engineering, and more. You’ll learn from people from a uniquely broad variety of backgrounds and translate concepts between them.
Make connections. We work in almost every industry on projects that range from the earliest stages of design and strategy to later phases of bringing new products and services to market. You’ll work to see patterns across these contexts, and apply what you’ve learned in one context to another.

We’re Looking For Candidates Who Have

What we’re looking for:

Strong background in physical sciences, social sciences, digital humanities, or methods
Fluency at writing code to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data, as well as implementing algorithms in code (but don’t necessarily need to know about production software engineering)
Experience developing or leveraging creative new approaches to data analysis
Experience bringing data to life via visualizations and storytelling
Excellence in making data human, and sharing results simultaneously to those with and without deep quantitative experience

Through the interview process, we’ll be looking for evidence of these qualifications, but we don’t require any specific technical skills. We recognize these qualifications may be embodied in different ways — in fact, we get most excited by new ways people embody these that add something new to our team!

Likewise, we don’t have a specific requirement for degrees or years of work experience. However, we have observed that many of these qualifications are developed through full-time work experience (either as a data scientist or something else entirely), participation in community organizations, open-source software projects, graduate academic research, or something else.

What does IDEO offer you?

IDEO is a place unlike any other. It’s a place where you can solve diverse, complex challenges for our clients or the organization, alongside thoughtful, intelligent individuals who lead with curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Sure we work hard, but we also intentionally craft moments that allow our community to pause, create, and connect. We encourage our community to bring their whole selves to work, respect the need for work-life balance, and allow for autonomy in the design process and your career.

Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

At IDEO, we are committed to the work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within our organization and in the world. We have a collective responsibility to design new systems. We have attempted to do so in some of our work, but we have not moved as quickly or as boldly as we should have. We cannot be successful until we re-examine our values, our relationships, and how we practice design itself.

We are committed to centering equity across IDEO in talent, training, community, design, and culture. A lot of work is being done to bring us closer to realizing this goal, but we’re still early in our learning journey towards understanding what it means to become an equitable organization. As we are continually working towards and providing attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion, we are looking for candidates who are committed to continuing this work with us.

How To Apply

Please apply with a resume and cover letter by November 26, 2021. We will be reviewing applications on a rolling basis after the application deadline.

Frequently Asked Questions:
What kinds of data and databases will I be working with?
The majority of our data consists of structured data, like student metrics and demographics, but we also have plenty of free-form student < > coach interaction data that we’ve performed very limited NLP analysis on (this is where you will come in!). Most of that data is inputted and stored in Salesforce, but we also have data from our MyCoach mobile app, and our CoachBox communication platform stored in MySQL databases. Currently, all data sources get ingested into centralized cloud storage, which dashboards are built on top of.
What types of models will I be working with?
We have spent the past few years utilizing ML vendors to build our models. One of which is an XGBoost binary classification model used to predict drop-out. The other is a neural network model used to output attitudinal dimensions.
Will I be building any models from scratch?
Short answer, no - We have deepened our collaboration with our ML vendors such that they are the ones who train and run the algorithms, meaning that you'll have more time for fun stuff like data interpretation/visualization and experimentation design! That being said, you will still be expected to do some of the feature engineering required to feed our data into their system.
What kinds of languages and libraries will I use, and for what?
The majority of our data automation scripts are written in Python, heavily leaning on the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. These scripts are primarily used for transforming data received from partners or external sources into the required format of our internal databases, performing analyses of various pilots, and producing visualizations. We run SQL queries almost every minute of every day (almost kidding), in order to extract and transform data for our models, or to run analyses. We have used R pretty sparingly, mainly for cleaning and analyzing large datasets more efficiently. As Beyond 12’s data scientist, you will have free reign (and be expected) to explore and institute any data science packages or libraries of any language that will help strengthen our analytics.
How large is the data team?
The mighty data team currently consists of the Chief Knowledge Officer, Manager of Data Operations, Senior Data Engineer, Associate Data Analyst, and Special Projects Data Analyst. There are plans to hire a Director of Data Insights and Research and Learning Analyst within the next few months.

DESCRIPTION

Job Summary

Millions of Sellers list their products for sale on the Amazon Marketplace. Sellers are a critical part of Amazon’s ecosystem to deliver on our vision of offering the Earth’s largest selection and lowest prices. In this ecosystem, the International Seller Services org (ISS) plays a critical role in enabling Sellers across EU5, China, Japan, Australia, Brazil and Turkey to make their Selection available to customers globally and deliver the experience they have come to expect from Amazon.

In Jeff’s own words (2019 Q1 shareholders letter): “Something strange and remarkable has happened over the last 20 years. Take a look at these numbers:1999 3% …… 2018 58%. The % represent the share of physical gross merchandise sales sold on Amazon by independent third-party sellers – mostly small- and medium-sized businesses – as opposed to Amazon retail's own first party sales. Third-party sales have grown from 3% of the total to 58%. To put it bluntly: Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly.…. Why were independent sellers able to grow so much faster than Amazon's own highly organized first-party sales organization? There isn't one answer, but we do know one extremely important part of the answer: We helped independent sellers compete against our first-party business by investing in and offering them the very best selling tools we could imagine and build. There are many such tools, including tools that help sellers manage inventory, process payments, track shipments, create reports, and sell across borders – and we're inventing more every year.”

Leaf is on a mission to upend the way companies buy and sell transportation. Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren’t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed.

We are a team of experienced, smart, and mildly disagreeable troublemakers who like taking on unreasonably big challenges; we know how to build things, we’ve lived what’s broken in this industry, and we’re looking for bright, ambitious people to help us drag the transportation world kicking and screaming into the 21st century.

What does an applied data scientist do at Leaf?

We ingest, clean and process large amounts of data from a variety of sources including shippers, carriers, 3PLs and 3rd party data providers.

Identify and quantify business value applying a diverse set of supply chain improvement levers
Ensure high level of quality of results generated by Leaf’s algorithms
Provide feedback to the rest of the data science and engineering team to ensure continuous improvement of the internal data engine
Build visualizations to clearly communicate results and customer business value
Perform ad-hoc and on-demand analyses for internal stakeholders and customers
Prioritize your time and attention to maximize the impact of limited resources

Who makes a good applied data scientist?

You should be curious, relentless about asking questions until you understand something, and unafraid to acknowledge facts that don’t point in the direction you want them to. Be humble in the face of data, but tenacious in asserting the facts you know.

Be willing to work with people you disagree with; be eager for criticism, and constantly searching for ways to do what you do better. Never be content with things the way they are, but don’t let the quest for something perfect prevent you from shipping something good.

You Will Need To Be Experienced With Python, And SQL As Well As Familiarity With The Majority Of The Following

Experience in wider supply chain, especially truckload, is useful.

Geospatial analysis
Pattern recognition
Clustering
Time series forecasting
Graph-theoretic techniques for network analysis

We’re also a startup, priorities change all the time, something’s always on fire, and there’s twice as much work to do as hands to do it and new challenges surface constantly, and that you will need to be able to manage how you spend your time in the midst of conflicting priorities.

Compensation

Leaf offers a very comprehensive compensation package including competitive base salary, variable compensation and health benefits.

Leaf Logistics is an equal-opportunity employer and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. If you’re a passionate team player who wants to have an outsized impact on a diverse and dynamic team, we’d love to hear from you!

2802992111,Data Scientist,IDEO,2021-11-17,United States,"San Francisco, CA",Engineering and Information Technology,Full-time,"Marketing and Advertising, Computer Software, and Internet Publishing","Please apply with a resume and cover letter by November 26, 2021. We will be reviewing applications on a rolling basis after the application deadline.

In a Nutshell

IDEO’s Research and Insights practice is in search of a Data Scientist who is well-versed in leveraging data science methods to improve understanding and aid in discovery. This person will be a member of our client-facing design teams that inform design, innovation, and strategy across a broad spectrum of projects and help to advance our practice in new approaches to understanding complex problems. This position shares much in common with our recently posted Computational Social Scientist / Data Scientists positions but is open to a wider array of fields outside of the social sciences.

Why is this role important for IDEO’s work?

An IDEO Data Scientist makes the biggest impact by seamlessly integrating data-enabled research methods into the wider design process. This person is able to seek out, explore, and analyze existing data sets, as well as create new ones, to generate insights for design.

They are responsible for structuring human-centered research and leading multidisciplinary internal and client teams through developing quantitative research activities and tools (algorithm based, sensor based, or whatever best captures the need), communicating complex technical concepts and results with clients and teams, discovering and leveraging novel public data sources, leveraging new data science methods and tools, and otherwise finding smart ways to augment qualitative research processes and insights with those that are data-enabled.

Experience and confidence working in interdisciplinary teams and a demonstrated ability to establish empathy with participants in a variety of contexts is advantageous.

We don’t expect all candidates to have deep experience in every aspect of what’s described below, but rather look to build a team that holds strength in all of these areas. So, if you are not sure if this is a good fit, please apply and we’d be excited to learn more about your experience!

Once Here You Will

Center your work on people. We go to work because we want to improve peoples’ lives through design. You’ll talk with and design alongside the people our designs affect, to develop a deep understanding of their needs and their context and develop solutions.
Partner with our clients. It doesn’t matter how smart or creative our work is if it isn’t viable for our client’s business. You’ll get to know our clients’ values, strategy, and structure so that you can be an effective partner and make things happen.
Create tangible things, quickly. One of our values is “talk less, do more” and our work often requires quick iteration over perfection. You’ll perform data analysis, create visualizations/simulations, and implement statistical/machine learning/optimization algorithms — learning new techniques and tools as necessary.
Shape data science at IDEO (and beyond!). We believe that we have an opportunity to help conceive of a new way of practicing data science that improves business and society. You’ll explore approaches to practicing data science and share stories inside and outside of IDEO of what you’ve learned along the way.
Collaborate with inspiring colleagues. We’re a passionate and creative community from a variety of backgrounds: anthropology, software development, graphic design, management, journalism, architecture, engineering, and more. You’ll learn from people from a uniquely broad variety of backgrounds and translate concepts between them.
Make connections. We work in almost every industry on projects that range from the earliest stages of design and strategy to later phases of bringing new products and services to market. You’ll work to see patterns across these contexts, and apply what you’ve learned in one context to another.

We’re Looking For Candidates Who Have

What we’re looking for:

Strong background in physical sciences, social sciences, digital humanities, or methods
Fluency at writing code to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data, as well as implementing algorithms in code (but don’t necessarily need to know about production software engineering)
Experience developing or leveraging creative new approaches to data analysis
Experience bringing data to life via visualizations and storytelling
Excellence in making data human, and sharing results simultaneously to those with and without deep quantitative experience

Through the interview process, we’ll be looking for evidence of these qualifications, but we don’t require any specific technical skills. We recognize these qualifications may be embodied in different ways — in fact, we get most excited by new ways people embody these that add something new to our team!

Likewise, we don’t have a specific requirement for degrees or years of work experience. However, we have observed that many of these qualifications are developed through full-time work experience (either as a data scientist or something else entirely), participation in community organizations, open-source software projects, graduate academic research, or something else.

What does IDEO offer you?

IDEO is a place unlike any other. It’s a place where you can solve diverse, complex challenges for our clients or the organization, alongside thoughtful, intelligent individuals who lead with curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Sure we work hard, but we also intentionally craft moments that allow our community to pause, create, and connect. We encourage our community to bring their whole selves to work, respect the need for work-life balance, and allow for autonomy in the design process and your career.

Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

At IDEO, we are committed to the work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within our organization and in the world. We have a collective responsibility to design new systems. We have attempted to do so in some of our work, but we have not moved as quickly or as boldly as we should have. We cannot be successful until we re-examine our values, our relationships, and how we practice design itself.

We are committed to centering equity across IDEO in talent, training, community, design, and culture. A lot of work is being done to bring us closer to realizing this goal, but we’re still early in our learning journey towards understanding what it means to become an equitable organization. As we are continually working towards and providing attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion, we are looking for candidates who are committed to continuing this work with us.

2799527235,Data Scientist - Rare Diseases,Axle Informatics,2021-11-17,United States,"North Bethesda, MD",Information Technology,Full-time,IT Services and IT Consulting,"Axle Informatics is a bioinformatics and information technology company that offers innovative computer services, informatics, and enterprise solutions to research centers and healthcare organizations around the globe. With experts in software engineering, bioinformatics and program management, we focus on developing and applying technology tools and techniques to empower decision-making and accelerate the discovery in translational research. We work with some of the top research organizations and facilities in the country including multiple institutes at the National Institutes of health (NIH).

Axle is seeking a Data Scientist for the development of informatics infrastructure that supports the Genetic and Rare Diseases (GARD) information center and development of data models to support National Center for Translational Sciences (NCATS) Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR)’s rare diseases informatics initiatives.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Nation’s leading medical research agency and the primary federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability by supporting and making medical discoveries. NCATS is the only center at the NIH that focuses exclusively on all aspects of the translation of research with an innovative pipeline of treatment discoveries for all diseases. NCATS brings together a diverse group of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, clinicians, and engineers to translate basic science conducted elsewhere into products and services that help improve people’s health and lives. NCATS’ mission is to improve health through smarter science that results in better treatments faster for all diseases, rare or common. Within that remit, the NCATS ORDR’s mission is to advance rare disease research to benefit patients.

Currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the US, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. A rare disease is defined in US law (Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983,[1] Rare Diseases Act (RDA) of 2002[2]) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. Collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the US, making rare diseases a large public health consideration.

The ORDR’s GARD information center was established in 2003 under a Congressional Mandate (RDA 2002), and is a federally funded program that has an essential role in the dissemination of public health information to rare disease researchers, clinicians, and patients that is freely accessible to the public. However, obtaining accurate, comprehensive, timely, and objective information on rare diseases is often difficult, given the large number of rare diseases, rapidly evolving science (especially related to genomics), diverse data sources, and inconsistent nomenclature and ontologies for rare disease classification, among other issues. Recently, GARD has been undergoing a re-envisioning and re-design based on a Neo4j knowledge graph database that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources to keep the information on ~6,000 different rare diseases in GARD up-to-date and useful to the patient and clinical research communities. Research tools, artificial intelligent models, data visualization and informatics infrastructure based on the knowledge graph database will be developed to support rare diseases research and clinical activities, and to answer rare disease research questions likely to inform rare disease research prioritization.

[1] Orphan Drug Act of 1983, amended for prevalence 1984. Pub.L. 97-414

[2] Rare Diseases Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-280

Responsibilities

Develop and manage an existing database and informatics infrastructure that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources, such as disease classification/ontologies coding (e.g., ICD 10), genetics, clinical characteristics/phenotypic information, diagnosis, and treatment, among others.

Build data models to extract data and information from existing data sources using machine learning and/or natural language processing approaches.
Integrate the existing GARD knowledge graph database with other GARD-related information and data streams, and build robust pipelines to keep the data up to date and harmonized.
Design and develop APIs for user access to the knowledge graph database and connect it to other NCATS and NIH databases.
Design system and software architect as well as develop computational tools, interactive visualization interfaces and web-based applications for users to access and utilize the existing knowledge database.
Work collaboratively with other data scientists and developers in informatics support for rare disease research.
Identify, collect, quality check and integrate rare disease data, such as disease characteristics, genetics and healthcare systems data from diverse resources to permit data analysis. Build standard pipelines in data processing and automate the graph database update process.
Create informatics solutions to answer research questions in rare diseases using the knowledge graph database.

Qualifications

Doctoral degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Bioinformatics, Information Systems or other related field.
PhD and 2+ years of experience in data mining and modeling, database development, software development and/or web application development.
Experience and good understanding in working with biomedical data, such as disease characteristics, genetics and/or other healthcare systems data.
Deep understanding of object-oriented programming.
Experience working with Linux/Unix operating systems.
Experience in software architect design, data mining, machine learning and/or natural language processing.
Good understanding of the software development life cycle.

Experience in database and web application development.
Experience in API development, data visualization and/or parallel computing is highly preferred.
Experience in Graph, NoSQL, and/or RDBMS database, such as Neo4j, is highly preferred.
Experience in containers (e.g. Docker, Singularity), version control (e.g. GitHub) and workflow management (e.g. Snakemake) is highly preferred.
Ability to work independently on day-to-day tasks with minimal supervision.
Willing to learn new technologies and motivated to explore new solutions to address complex rare disease research questions.

This role requires a strong passion for customers, a high level of comfort navigating ambiguity, and a keen sense of ownership and drive to deliver results.

We have a global investment focus and have invested in 7 unicorns in 7 years. We hold a strong belief that data is revolutionizing venture capital investments and our early results reinforce that. We are currently expanding our ambitions and our team. Data has been critical to Goodwater’s success since our founding. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of quantitative investing in venture capital. Our team combines statistical models in production with qualitative insights to find promising companies and help them grow.

We’re looking for accomplished data scientists to support our goal of empowering exceptional companies. We encourage every member of the team to explore creative ideas and utilize their background expertise to help us with our mission.

What makes you a good fit for the Goodwater investment team:

Insatiable curiosity - you aren’t just satisfied with an answer and are hungry for understanding “why?”

Entrepreneurial - You’re comfortable with moving fast and adapting to fluid roadmaps and priorities. You aren’t afraid of failure and look for creative solutions to overcome challenges.

Humility - You have come to realize that the more knowledge you gain, the less you actually know, and that pushes you to continually seek knowledge from others.

You are service-oriented: Venture capital is fundamentally a service business and we exist to serve and support our portfolio companies.

You are passionate about consumer technology: 140 character tweets, vertical e-commerce, the “disruption of institutionalized industries” such as healthcare and finance – our team members live and thrive in the world of apps and internet services that impact the day to day lives of consumers. Your passion emanates in conversations with the team and is reflective of our mission.

You are truth-seeking: We embrace the mantra “strong opinions, loosely held.” Data Scientists who thrive at Goodwater are comfortable pushing back against a (near) consensus decision, and celebrate when their own point-of-view is challenged. Data is likely your favorite currency.

You embrace data science as a team-sport: You don’t focus on who built this model, or who was the first to identify a solution. Instead, you use every opportunity to put your best foot forward as a team and are excited to pitch in whether it’s for a strategic project, prep for a meeting, or working with other teams to problem solve.

If this sounds like you, here are some qualifications we’re looking for:

Required

Ideally 3-8 years of experience. We are hiring across junior and senior positions.
Excellent communication skills, especially toward technical and non-technical audiences.
Passion for understanding consumer tech companies.
Experience analyzing data for tech companies.
Experience identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies from large data sets.
Ability to interpret and present analytical insights to stakeholders.
Knowledge of statistics and experience building statistical models.
Proficiency in Python or other data analysis tools.
Fluency in SQL.
Preferred

Experience evaluating investment opportunities, for example at a bank, VC firm, or hedge fund.
Experience implementing machine learning models using TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, or other libraries.
Experience writing and debugging production-grade code.
About Goodwater Capital

The mission of Goodwater Capital is to empower exceptional entrepreneurs who are changing the world. We are 100% focused on consumer tech, an area that we define simply as apps and services adopted directly by consumers. Goodwater is founded on the belief that we are experiencing an explosion of consumer-driven opportunities in communications, community, and commerce. We are excited to see great entrepreneurs pioneering powerful new platforms to serve consumers across a broad range of industries including local services, marketplaces, health care, education, financial services, and wearables… just to name a few. Goodwater is focused on consumer tech investments and our chief investment criteria is simple — a product or service that customers LOVE. Goodwater was founded in 2014 and manages over $2B across several venture capital funds. We are actively investing and building a growing portfolio of exciting consumer audience, commerce, and services startups that will become the next generation of platform companies.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Your analysis and solution recommendations will drive system optimizations with global impact. You will develop metrics to quantify the benefits of a solution and influence project resources. You will audit metric data and use it to measure system impact and performance.

You will harness massive and diverse data sets to mine actionable insights for senior leaders. You will automate data feeds, validate the data input and analyze trends that lead to cost saving initiatives. In this role, you will own solving problems through deep data review, statistical analyses, and creation of analytic tools usable by others on the team. Your work products will guide our reporting, benchmarking, program optimization, financial planning, and execution strategy.

The ideal candidate is a motivated self-starter who can thrive in a fast-paced environment. They will enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and business leaders. They will seek to understand processes behind data so their recommendations are grounded.

Support the business. We perform analyses, build models, and run experiments to make the Klaviyo business more efficient. You’ll work directly with stakeholders within the company and contribute directly to business processes at Klaviyo.

We’re looking for people who are strong at math, modeling, experimental design, and putting themselves in the shoes of customers. You should be interested in all aspects of what it takes to go from idea to generally available feature or internal solution, even if your strengths and experience today fall primarily in one area.

The ideal candidate has a background in data science, statistics and machine learning and has done work ranging from exploratory analysis to training and deploying models. We use a wide variety of data mining and machine learning algorithms. The right candidate will have both a solid fundamental understanding of and practical experience with at least a few modeling and machine learning techniques.

Have demonstrated a measurable impact based on the models you’ve created. It’s not always easy getting a model correct and we love talking about places we got stuck and working as a team to think through ideas that could unblock us.
Have a desire to ship features powered by data science (in other words, you’re excited by both upfront research and actually getting models into production at cloud scale); OR
Have a desire to work directly with business stakeholders to create tools that will provide insight and make them more efficient.
Bachelor’s or advanced degree in statistics, applied mathematics, computer science or other relevant quantitative discipline, or equivalent industry experience.

2789874907,Machine Learning Engineer (Deep Learning),Glimpse.ai,2021-11-11,United States,"Baltimore, MD ",,Full-time,,"Glimpse.ai is looking for someone who thinks artificial intelligence is AWESOME.




What we are doing now:

We are a profitable and stable artificial intelligence startup that is building a tool that automatically writes content about any subject with the same level of quality, factual accuracy, and usefulness as a human.




What we are building towards:

Our goal is two parts:

Part one: Develop strong AI – artificial intelligence that is smarter than a human.

Part two: Do this without selling our souls to venture capitalists or outside investors who will be more focused on Q4 profit, than on making sure this technology creates a profoundly better society.




How we plan on getting towards that goal:

Glimpse.ai is entirely self-funded and is already profitable by selling awesome artificial intelligence products. We want to continue to advance artificial intelligence through sustainable, iterative, and self-funded improvements so that we can eventually reach our end goal while remaining independent and principled.




We have a product roadmap where we create and deliver products that our users love, with the requirement that everything we work on is furthering our research and understanding of complicated artificial intelligence concepts.




What you will be doing:

We currently sell a product that generates content based on user input using large transformer networks. Our customers love the product, the content looks and reads well, but still is lacking in factual accuracy and relevance.




You will be working directly with the Founder & CEO (who is leading the artificial intelligence team, both as a manager and as an individual contributor) and other Machine Learning Engineers to bridge this gap and build a product that is able to generate high quality, factually relevant and interesting content about any keyword that a user inputs.




This will involve training new models and making improvements to existing ones. You will constantly be ingesting research papers, finding and implementing ways to take what is cutting edge, and writing production code to apply it to our goals. You will be analyzing where our current methods are falling short and devising and implementing ways to improve and iterate.




What you’ll mainly be working in:

PyTorch (Hugging Face Transformers)




What we want from you:

You read this job posting and mission statement and found it to be inspiring
You have multiple years of experience (professional or research) directly working with transformers to solve natural language generation or information retrieval problems
You are up to date on state of the art research in natural language generation and/or information retrieval
You can immediately contribute research direction and implementation on how to use deep learning and transformers to write higher quality and more factually accurate articles
You are an awesome developer with a very strong Computer Science (or very similar) background
You take immense pride in the work you do and think you are exceptional
You want to be contributing ideas, values, thoughts, and direction (we are a small company, and your boss is the Founder/CEO, so we want people who want to make a mark on our direction and vision!)




Some benefits of working at Glimpse.ai include:

Generous salary – We would rather have one superstar than two mediocre players
Equity - Ownership in what you are creating at a fast growing startup
Premium benefits – Completely paid health coverage, 401k, profit sharing, gym membership, and more
Offices located on the water in Baltimore’s beautiful Fells Point district
Freedom of working at a small company – you will report directly to the CEO
The excitement of a startup with the stability of a profitable company
We work on interesting problems that push the envelope in AI

DESCRIPTION

Amazon’s Employee Relations (ER) team is looking for a Data Scientist (DS) with a demonstrated passion for building innovative new analytics, models, tools and processes for our Employees and Leaders. Are you looking for an opportunity to build in a completely new space that will stretch you and force you to demonstrate your mastery of data science, data analytics, problem solving and enterprise wide deployments? This DS will lead new pioneering ideas from concept to reality and in this role—new bold ideas are always welcome. This DS will obsess over the Amazon employee experience and the employee voice across the organization. This DS will directly apply their knowledge of Natural Language Processing engines to dig deep and help Amazon leaders gain insights from hundreds of thousands of comments from our employees. Finding, prioritizing and resolving employee experience defects will be the mission every day. Thus, the challenge of this role is that it is never complete; we will always strive to push Amazon to be the Earth’s best employer.

The Data Scientist will play a critical role in advancing our mission. You will join a tight-knit team of ER professionals, including HR, operational, program, product, tech and legal leaders. You will be supporting Amazon's World Wide Corporate, Consumer and Operations (WWCC & Ops) portfolio, and have direct impact on the daily work of over 1.3M+ Amazonians.

Our projects span multiple organizations and require coordination of experimentation, economic and causal analysis, forecasting, dashboarding and predictive machine learning tools. We’re looking for an enthusiastic technical expert and storyteller to explore the world of Amazon data to generate insights—connecting employee experiences to decision makers in a compelling way backed by data. Your focus will cover all aspects of how we learn more about our employees, uncover problems that need to be solved, and validating the impact of our solutions. You will work with other thinkers, creators, and communicators to build the skills of the entire team to create a research-driven organization. You will invent, refine solutions from start to finish—data sets, queries, models, reports, dashboards, analyses—to answer business questions while ensuring we are meeting the needs of the business and team goals. You will draw on your knowledge of data science best practices, big data management fundamentals, and analysis principles to build solutions that enable effective, data-driven business decisions. You will learn the business context and technologies behind your team’s data infrastructure and work with customers (e.g., researchers, economists, data engineers, business intelligence engineers, product managers) and other internal partners to ensure deliverables are aligned with expectations.

If you love getting to the “a-ha” moment, when the solution to a customer or employee problem reveals itself in the data— let’s talk
