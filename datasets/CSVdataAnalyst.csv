As an Analyst II on Lucid’s Strategy & Analytics team, you will be expected to be fluent in all aspects of strategic problem solving - from identifying opportunities to analyzing data, presenting results, and driving change. This role is designed for candidates who have already honed their technical skills working with data and are ready to take their careers to the next level.

As part of the team, you will rotate to a new function after 9-12 months, allowing you to see multiple sides of the business and expand your knowledge and experience.

The tool set you develop and use will be similar across these functions, but each presents domain-specific challenges that will provide unique opportunities for learning.

Some examples of past projects from our team include creating a customer health score to highlight at-risk accounts, identifying opportunities to accelerate product adoption at enterprise companies, creating tools to automate the analysis of A/B tests, finding ways to increase collaboration and virality of our product, and building dashboards to help sales reps target high-potential accounts.

Although your day-to-day work will be with the function to which you are assigned, you will be well-supported by the rest of the Strategy & Analytics team. While we are physically distributed throughout the office, we maintain close ties by holding weekly team trainings, daily working sessions, and regular team activities. We help each other whenever possible, and with the collective efforts of the full team, there’s rarely a question we can’t answer.

At Lucid, we stand by these core values: teamwork over ego; innovation in everything we do; individual empowerment, initiative, and ownership; and passion and excellence in every area. They aren’t just phrases to hang on the wall—they are what bring us together in a mission to help teams see and build the future.

We also know that innovation, creativity, and teamwork come more naturally in an environment where each employee is allowed to bring their whole self to work. To that end, we celebrate a diverse and inclusive work environment where people from various backgrounds are respected and supported for the unique perspectives they bring to the table. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or veteran status.

Excel — You know Excel better than I can explain it. You’ve used all the standard functions and can make sense of all the different tabs. You’re quick to share tips and can pivot and graph data in a way that’s ready for anyone’s needs

DESCRIPTION

Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. S3’s Automated Reasoning Group (S3-ARG) develops and applies automated reasoning techniques to deliver correct, secure, durable, and available distributed systems and storage services. S3 is complex: it consists of hundreds of micro-services each of which is a distributed system. With a very large number of servers and 10s of millions of requests per second, it is also highly concurrent. S3 has a sizable codebase, developed and maintained by a large team of engineers. Getting such a complex and fast-evolving system right requires developing cutting edge automated reasoning methods that are continuously integrated into the software development process. This is what our team does.

We work on techniques ranging from deductive proofs to model checking, from static analysis to runtime verification of protocols. We work both at the design and the code level, and connecting the two is essential for us. We partner with development teams to make sure that our methods are deployed across S3 and that correctness is maintained as the software evolves. We have had significant success with adoption and we are key contributors to recent S3 launches such as strong consistency. We are developing innovative methods all the time. We publish our results at conferences and journals.

We are a diverse team and are looking for teammates who are enthusiastic to work on these problems and further the state of the art with us. We are seeking candidates who are deep in one area of expertise but also broad enough to take on the most complex cloud computing challenges.

2803173521,"Applied Scientist, terrestrial ecosystem modeling",Earthshot Labs,2021-11-17,United States,United States,,Full-time,,"Applied Scientist, terrestrial ecosystem modeling (remote)




Design and launch a state of the art ecosystem simulator that models ecological and financial outcomes under future land management scenarios. Join Earthshot on a soulful ecological journey to restore our relationship with the sacred earth.




Earthshot Labs’ purpose is to use AI to catalyze planetary-scale land regeneration.




We conduct core ecological research and build technology products that inspire landowners to restore their land, and easily onboard them to carbon marketplaces at no cost. Earthshot also develops land restoration and carbon projects around the world.




Earthshot believes that people are most effective and happy when they bring their whole selves into their work, so they can unleash their full genius. We take shared breaths together, we discuss subjects that are deeply meaningful and at times vulnerable. We actively maintain a coherent field of deeply held love for nature and restoring humankind’s place within it. Despite our best intentions we are keenly aware of the potential problems inherent in creating a tech platform to engineer large scale land use, and so we are engaging with indigenous leaders, ecological experts, regenerative farmers, and other groups with deep knowledge of the land in order to ensure we have the highest integrity and wisdom infusing our efforts.




Earthshot is building two products that enable its vision: LandOS and Biome. LandOS is a platform for enabling landowners to envision and manifest the regeneration of land they have stewardship over. Our intention is to build a product that inspires our customers to be bold, to delight and engage them while they envision the future possibilities of the land in ways never possible before. Biome is our Unity app that collects nature observations in the most accurate, fun and engaging way using the smartphone’s neural engine, camera, and augmented reality capabilities. The data collected is used to power both fundamental ecological research as well as to underpin our LandOS system for envisioning and manifesting land restoration.




The Role

We're looking for an ecologist who has experience with modeling plant ecosystems, focusing on the carbon cycle. Knowledge of global plant species distribution models is a plus. In this role you'll have the opportunity to work with a world-class team of scientists and engineers, to build and deploy the ecological prediction module that will form the backend to LandOS. Your work will directly impact Earthshot's methodology for determining how carbon is expected to accumulate in restored ecosystems over time, under different management scenarios. Through reading the primary research literature and working with state-of-the-art ecosystem models, you will aid in designing a modeling system that accurately portrays ecosystem services, and the financial outcomes for landowners that will catalyze ecological restoration on a massive scale.

Requirements:

Advanced degree in terrestrial ecology (e.g. biology, ecology, geography)
Experience with land surface modeling (e.g. Community Land Model)
Experience with remotely sensed global ecological data sets (e.g. above ground biomass, soil carbon, leaf area index)
Experience with applying data science and machine learning to solving scientific problems 
Proficiency in Python or another scripting language commonly used for machine learning
Strong written and oral communication skills, as evidenced through research grants, publications, or conference presentations
Ability to define and execute projects on a timeline
A deep love for nature and desire to help build a more integrated future for humanity within it




Nice-to-haves:

Experience with species distribution modeling
Experience building and deploying enterprise-grade machine learning systems, e.g. in private industry
Experience with GCP, AWS or Azure




Culture: The process is the product.




By now, you’ll probably have realized that Earthshot is a different type of organization than most other companies you’ve encountered. We’re inherently mission-driven for profound human and ecological impact. Even more important is the way we work together: the quality of communication, team coherence, creating conditions for the genius and creativity of our team members, recognizing the comprehensive lives that we each lead. Our vision for team culture is informed by teal management, a shared love of nature, and the cultivation of healthy human relationships. Earthshot is fundamentally motivated by love, and is an organization where heart-centered people can together apply their world-class talent to the biggest challenges of our time. We are a natively remote organization, which means that people can choose to work from home whenever they would like, and we have team gatherings every 1-3 months to build team coherence, foster deep relationships with each other, and enjoy nature together. In the future, we imagine permanent retreat places for teams to work for weeks or months at a time together in gorgeous natural settings.




Diversity: 

Earthshot is building a company that honors the awe-inspiring complex diversity of the whole earth. We prioritize hiring team members that expand our team’s representation of race, color, ancestry, religion, gender identity, national origin, sexual orientation, age, relationship style, and many other dimensions of diversity. We welcome introverts, weirdos, hippies, and anyone else with high emotional intelligence, passionate ecological commitment, and brilliant skills that maybe don’t fulfill the usual societal norms. This isn't just about inclusion or equity. We believe that the genius of diverse peoples and backgrounds is essential to create culture and technology that reflect the world we want to live in.




Details and Application:

Salary $100-120k before our series A + early employee equity.

Note: This is a VC funded company, and early employee equity will far outweigh any salary compensation.




To apply:

Optional: take a 1 - 3 minute video about yourself, your genius, what you want to contribute to Earthshot, and what you want to receive in this next phase of your life and career (include this on the application linked below).
Fill out the questionnaire on the jobs page on the website.

Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. S3’s Automated Reasoning Group (S3-ARG) develops and applies automated reasoning techniques to deliver correct, secure, durable, and available distributed systems and storage services. S3 is complex: it consists of over 300 microservices each of which is a distributed system. With a very large number of servers and 10s of millions of requests per second, it is also highly concurrent. S3 has a sizable codebase, developed and maintained by a large team of engineers. Getting such a complex and fast-evolving system right requires developing cutting edge automated reasoning methods that are continuously integrated into the software development process. This is what our team does.

We work on techniques ranging from deductive proofs to model checking, from static analysis to runtime verification of protocols. We work both at the design and the code level, and connecting the two is essential for us. We partner with development teams to make sure that our methods are deployed across S3 and that correctness is maintained as the software evolves. We have had significant success with adoption and we are key contributors to recent S3 launches such as strong consistency. We are developing innovative methods all the time. We publish our results at conferences and journals.

We are a diverse team and are looking for teammates who are enthusiastic to work on these problems and further the state of the art with us. We are seeking candidates who are deep in one area of expertise but also broad enough to take on the most complex cloud computing challenges. If you are interested in exploring, please e-mail s3-arg-jobs@amazon.com.

Amazon is the 4th most popular site in the US. Our product search engine, one of the most heavily used services in the world, indexes billions of products and serves hundreds of millions of customers world-wide. We are working on a new initiative to transform our search engine into a shopping engine that assists customers with their shopping missions. We’re looking at every aspect of search, from query understanding to front-end UX, ranking and relevance, indexing and tiering and asking how we can make big step improvements by applying advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This is a rare opportunity to develop cutting edge ML solutions and apply them to a search problem of this magnitude. Some exciting questions that we expect to answer over the next few years include:

Can we deeply understand customer intent and personalize their search experience even when they type broad queries such as “dress” or “espresso machine”?

Can we reduce the cost of serving customer queries on Amazon by orders of magnitude using ML to predict n-grams and tuples that many queries decompose into, apply expensive ranking functions offline to identify the most relevant products that match these terms, and index these for efficient online retrieval? We expect this to lead to exciting research at the intersection of systems and ML.

Can we deeply understand the catalog to surface products that offer the most value to a customer? The challenge here is that the definition of value is subjective and personal, and therefore requires a deeper understanding of the customers intent as well as preferences.

Can we use deep learning to transfer behavioral signals from frequently purchased products in the head to products in the tail where behavioral signals are sparse? The challenge here is the scale, and the fact that the head and torso contain only a small fraction of products while the tail contains an overwhelmingly large fraction of the products in the catalog.

We have hired ML experts from leading research labs and academia to spearhead this effort. Our research leaders include Trishul Chilimbi (formerly MSR), Inderjit Dhillon (UT Austin), Guy Lebanon (formerly Georgia Tech), and S.V.N. (Vishy) Vishwanathan (formerly UC Santa Cruz). We are looking to hire Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and ML Applied Scientists at all levels, with experience in Search, Personalization, NLP, Systems, ML, DL and UI Design.
