Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

Job Description

Content is king — Square merchants succeed when their content conveys the story and value of their products effectively. Yet the average merchant is not an expert in product photography, copywriting, SEO, or design. Furthermore, the average merchant has many existing sources of content available to them, but digitizing them to put them on an online store requires tedious manual effort. These factors hinder merchants from putting their best foot forward and starting selling online quickly.

The Square Ecommerce ML team focuses on removing these frictions by using ML to help merchants import, manage, and improve their content. We have successful applications for some of these problems, but we're still discovering the best ways to accomplish this and the best applications for ML in this context. We're looking for a creative ML Engineer that is interested in building merchant-facing products, that is excited about finding novel ways of applying existing ML techniques to create exciting new products, and that is comfortable finding the right balance of algorithmic performance and simplicity to reduce time-to-market.

You Will

In a Nutshell

IDEO’s Research and Insights practice is in search of a Data Scientist who is well-versed in leveraging data science methods to improve understanding and aid in discovery. This person will be a member of our client-facing design teams that inform design, innovation, and strategy across a broad spectrum of projects and help to advance our practice in new approaches to understanding complex problems. This position shares much in common with our recently posted Computational Social Scientist / Data Scientists positions but is open to a wider array of fields outside of the social sciences.

Why is this role important for IDEO’s work?

An IDEO Data Scientist makes the biggest impact by seamlessly integrating data-enabled research methods into the wider design process. This person is able to seek out, explore, and analyze existing data sets, as well as create new ones, to generate insights for design.

They are responsible for structuring human-centered research and leading multidisciplinary internal and client teams through developing quantitative research activities and tools (algorithm based, sensor based, or whatever best captures the need), communicating complex technical concepts and results with clients and teams, discovering and leveraging novel public data sources, leveraging new data science methods and tools, and otherwise finding smart ways to augment qualitative research processes and insights with those that are data-enabled.

Experience and confidence working in interdisciplinary teams and a demonstrated ability to establish empathy with participants in a variety of contexts is advantageous.

We don’t expect all candidates to have deep experience in every aspect of what’s described below, but rather look to build a team that holds strength in all of these areas. So, if you are not sure if this is a good fit, please apply and we’d be excited to learn more about your experience!

Once Here You Will

Center your work on people. We go to work because we want to improve peoples’ lives through design. You’ll talk with and design alongside the people our designs affect, to develop a deep understanding of their needs and their context and develop solutions.
Partner with our clients. It doesn’t matter how smart or creative our work is if it isn’t viable for our client’s business. You’ll get to know our clients’ values, strategy, and structure so that you can be an effective partner and make things happen.
Create tangible things, quickly. One of our values is “talk less, do more” and our work often requires quick iteration over perfection. You’ll perform data analysis, create visualizations/simulations, and implement statistical/machine learning/optimization algorithms — learning new techniques and tools as necessary.
Shape data science at IDEO (and beyond!). We believe that we have an opportunity to help conceive of a new way of practicing data science that improves business and society. You’ll explore approaches to practicing data science and share stories inside and outside of IDEO of what you’ve learned along the way.
Collaborate with inspiring colleagues. We’re a passionate and creative community from a variety of backgrounds: anthropology, software development, graphic design, management, journalism, architecture, engineering, and more. You’ll learn from people from a uniquely broad variety of backgrounds and translate concepts between them.
Make connections. We work in almost every industry on projects that range from the earliest stages of design and strategy to later phases of bringing new products and services to market. You’ll work to see patterns across these contexts, and apply what you’ve learned in one context to another.

We’re Looking For Candidates Who Have

What we’re looking for:

Strong background in physical sciences, social sciences, digital humanities, or methods
Fluency at writing code to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data, as well as implementing algorithms in code (but don’t necessarily need to know about production software engineering)
Experience developing or leveraging creative new approaches to data analysis
Experience bringing data to life via visualizations and storytelling
Excellence in making data human, and sharing results simultaneously to those with and without deep quantitative experience

Through the interview process, we’ll be looking for evidence of these qualifications, but we don’t require any specific technical skills. We recognize these qualifications may be embodied in different ways — in fact, we get most excited by new ways people embody these that add something new to our team!

Likewise, we don’t have a specific requirement for degrees or years of work experience. However, we have observed that many of these qualifications are developed through full-time work experience (either as a data scientist or something else entirely), participation in community organizations, open-source software projects, graduate academic research, or something else.

What does IDEO offer you?

IDEO is a place unlike any other. It’s a place where you can solve diverse, complex challenges for our clients or the organization, alongside thoughtful, intelligent individuals who lead with curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Sure we work hard, but we also intentionally craft moments that allow our community to pause, create, and connect. We encourage our community to bring their whole selves to work, respect the need for work-life balance, and allow for autonomy in the design process and your career.

Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

At IDEO, we are committed to the work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within our organization and in the world. We have a collective responsibility to design new systems. We have attempted to do so in some of our work, but we have not moved as quickly or as boldly as we should have. We cannot be successful until we re-examine our values, our relationships, and how we practice design itself.

We are committed to centering equity across IDEO in talent, training, community, design, and culture. A lot of work is being done to bring us closer to realizing this goal, but we’re still early in our learning journey towards understanding what it means to become an equitable organization. As we are continually working towards and providing attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion, we are looking for candidates who are committed to continuing this work with us.

We operate at the near-atomic level, capturing signals produced by DNA replication using Nature's own machinery. There is plenty of room at the bottom, accompanied by the challenges of observing Nature at this scale. Our goal is to take the abundance of noisy, nano-scale measurements and reveal the underling biological truth using well-founded, state-of-the-art techniques including physical models, statistical models, and machine learning techniques. We continuously improve our system to increase the accuracy and yield of our sequencing runs.

We seek people who have a passion about the ability of genomic medicine to transform the world for the better. You have the demonstrated background and ability to take extremely-challenging, imperfect, real-world observations of the natural world and rigorously extract the underlying truth with exact quantified measures of uncertainty which then lead to actionable results. You have intuition for mathematical modeling problems, analytical skills to back it up, and can clearly and concisely communicate results that hold up under scrutiny. If you can relate to Markov, Chebyshev, Chernoff, Hoeffding and build performant neural networks that take impossible ideas to tangible results, then you should come join us.

What You'll Do

Dive deep into data, learning and understanding the characteristics to extract both clear and hidden patterns.
Explore models that capture fundamental information about single-molecule detection systems. Explore currently existing models and formulate completely novel approaches.
Focus efforts on key initiatives that build on the core PacBio platform value to deliver solutions to extremely valuable unmet needs in medicine and human health.
Enable entirely new areas of biological discovery in everything from human to viruses
Make impossibly good things a reality that apply at-scale to transform health for the entire planet.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

2800906829,Senior Data Scientist - Machine Learning [Remote],HiRoad,2021-11-19,United States,"Brunswick, ME",Engineering and Information Technology,Full-time,Insurance,"Our Mission

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

Minimum Qualifications

3+ years of demonstrable expertise building and supporting machine learning models deployed to production
Expert in Python and core libraries used by data scientists (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, etc.)
Experience using Jupyter notebooks
Experience working with large and/or noisy data sets

Machine Learning Focus

Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Robust techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern methods: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.

Additional Details

Salary: We pay competitive salaries factoring in experience, skill set, and location. We do not offer equity.
We provide a wide-selection of health and welfare benefits including medical, dental, vision, life insurance, and supplemental income plans. We also offer a 401(k) Plan with a company match.
Wellness and Time Off: We provide Headspace subscriptions, a wellness allowance, and generous time off including four weeks of PTO in the first year of employment with additional time granted upon hire. New parents may also take eight weeks of fully paid parental leave (plus four weeks for parents who give birth) which may be taken within one year after the birth and/or the adoption of a child.
Professional learning and growth: We provide a generous allowance each year for professional learning, continuing education, and career development.
Location: May work from anywhere in the US, but will need to be actively available during core meeting hours from 9:00AM - 3:00PM pacific time to collaborate with team members across all time zones.
Some travel may be required after the San Francisco office re-opens.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

Machine Learning Focus

Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Robust techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern methods: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

2800906868,Senior Data Scientist - Machine Learning [Remote],HiRoad,2021-11-19,United States,"Leawood, KS",Engineering and Information Technology,Full-time,Insurance,"Our Mission

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

3+ years of demonstrable expertise building and supporting machine learning models deployed to production
Expert in Python and core libraries used by data scientists (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, etc.)
Experience using Jupyter notebooks
Experience working with large and/or noisy data sets

Machine Learning Focus

Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Robust techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern methods: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.

Additional Details

Salary: We pay competitive salaries factoring in experience, skill set, and location. We do not offer equity.
We provide a wide-selection of health and welfare benefits including medical, dental, vision, life insurance, and supplemental income plans. We also offer a 401(k) Plan with a company match.
Wellness and Time Off: We provide Headspace subscriptions, a wellness allowance, and generous time off including four weeks of PTO in the first year of employment with additional time granted upon hire. New parents may also take eight weeks of fully paid parental leave (plus four weeks for parents who give birth) which may be taken within one year after the birth and/or the adoption of a child.
Professional learning and growth: We provide a generous allowance each year for professional learning, continuing education, and career development.
Location: May work from anywhere in the US, but will need to be actively available during core meeting hours from 9:00AM - 3:00PM pacific time to collaborate with team members across all time zones.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

Experience using Jupyter notebooks
Experience working with large and/or noisy data sets

Machine Learning Focus

Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Robust techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern methods: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

We make good things happen by recognizing and rewarding people for taking the high road. How? By reinventing insurance that celebrates people's mindful choices.

Insurance was fundamentally a brilliant idea, but it always had a key challenge - it couldn't identify and acknowledge the positive decisions that individuals made along the way. But when we apply smart mobile technologies, we can. And that's what we do. We help our customers save on their monthly bill. But more importantly, they join a growing movement of people who dare to live more mindfully because doing so is simply better for everyone.

We're a well-funded, talent dense team of people who care about using our skills to do good. From data science, to design, engineering, insurance, product, research, user experience and beyond - we believe in people who believe they can make the world even better. Join us, and let's build the higher path that is HiRoad.

Expert in Python and core libraries used by data scientists (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, etc.)
Experience using Jupyter notebooks
Experience working with large and/or noisy data sets

Machine Learning Focus

Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Robust techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern methods: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.
