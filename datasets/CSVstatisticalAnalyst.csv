2799824754,"Analyst, Data Science and Business Operations",Up&Up,2021-11-17,United States,New York City Metropolitan Area,,Full-time,,"The problem:

America is going through a housing affordability crisis, where access to ownership is growing increasingly out of reach. 33% of Americans are renting, and 25% of those that are renting spend over half of their income on rent. As a direct result, nearly 75% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. These numbers are projected to only get worse for future generations, as student debt and the cost of living continue to balloon.

Up&Up offers a way for renters to access the financial benefits of ownership while they pay rent, providing a new, accessible modality for wealth creation. As the first program to give renters access to home price appreciation and cash flow on rental income, Up&Up allows renters to access the financial benefits of ownership with the flexibility of renting.

We're looking for talented, hard-working, and passionate team members to help us make the benefits of ownership accessible to all.

One of the biggest (and most fun) challenges that we face is constructing a data driven real estate platform so that our real estate investors and customers win. As an analyst specializing in Data Science and Business Operations, you'll leverage your technical skills to solve a variety of critical problems around the business.

This is not your typical analyst role - every member of our team has the chance to work on mission critical projects and grow quickly with the company. From your first week at work, you'll be given responsibility for key projects and the opportunity to take on challenging problems.

What you'll do:

Rapidly diagnose and develop data driven solutions to key problems across the business
Develop statistical and machine learning models that facilitate deal execution, customer research, and more
Develop and maintain data processing pipelines and dashboards that inform key business decisions
Own all aspects of technical projects from planning to implementation
Coordinate with key stakeholders around the business to understand the implications of technical projects

Cogo Labs Leadership Principles

Take Big Swings


Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

Data Driven


Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

Make Moonshine


Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

Insist on the Highest Standards


Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

Bias for Action


Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

Have Integrity; Earn Trust


Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

Hire and Develop the Best


Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

Ownership


Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

Disagree and Commit


Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

Dive Deep


Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

Deliver Results


Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Cogo Labs Leadership Principles

Take Big Swings


Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

Data Driven


Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

Make Moonshine


Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

Insist on the Highest Standards


Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

Bias for Action


Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

Have Integrity; Earn Trust


Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

Hire and Develop the Best


Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

Ownership


Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

Disagree and Commit


Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

Dive Deep


Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

Deliver Results


Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Zeitworks is a Seattle-based venture-backed startup on a mission to streamline business process improvement and maximize human potential at work.

In every organization, teams are executing hundreds of repetitive business processes. Team members and business leaders alike want to improve these processes, but often cannot because they don't have visibility into how these processes are actually performed.

Traditionally, the only way to discover and improve business processes has involved big projects, expensive consultants, intrusive over-the-shoulder observations, and countless meetings. The results are one-time snapshots of limited accuracy that take months to produce, and then are quickly out of date.

At Zeitworks, we use automated data collection and Machine Learning to automatically discover, analyze and improve an organization's business processes with zero disruption, and provide business leaders with business insights in near real-time. Our disruptive technology and SaaS delivery model allow us to democratize process improvement by taking it directly to the leaders and team members that perform the work. With Zeitworks, companies can make improvements to upgrade their efficiency and their customer experience.

Familiarity with cloud hosting platforms such as AWS, GCP, Azure
Interest in developing customer onboarding and implementation plans by understanding their business processes and delivering the desired dashboards and metrics.

ZEITWORKS TEAM VALUES

Continuous improvement; whether it's our customers or our team, we strive to help everyone to reach their full potential both individually and organizationally. We make every decision and measure every outcome based on how well it serves our customers and builds their trust.

Empowerment comes by showing people how their actions directly impact the businesses' goals, helping them to focus on what matters the most. We balance autonomy with accountability and risk with credibility. We develop leaders who can determine how to best increase our value to our customers and the company.

Speed matters but it requires a well informed team, a plan, and measurable outcomes. Some mistakes will be made along the way but that's good; it means decisions are being made. Even if things don't go as planned, it's an opportunity to share and to learn.

Integrity based on honesty, transparency and follow through, with no politics, hidden agendas or passive-aggressive behavior, builds trust. We share an obligation to respectfully put forth challenges when we disagree or see a problem; holding each other accountable ensures our collective success.

Diversity in who we are, our experiences, and our opinions, enables us to find creative and innovative solutions to challenging problems. We strive to create a culture based on humility and respect to ensure everyone can thrive.

2774723196,Data Annotation Analyst,Zeitworks,2021-10-26,United States,"Seattle, WA",Information Technology,Full-time,"IT Services and IT Consulting, Computer Software, and Internet Publishing","Overview

Zeitworks is a Seattle-based venture-backed startup on a mission to streamline business process improvement and maximize human potential at work.

In every organization, teams are executing hundreds of repetitive business processes. Team members and business leaders alike want to improve these processes, but often cannot because they don't have visibility into how these processes are actually performed.

Traditionally, the only way to discover and improve business processes has involved big projects, expensive consultants, intrusive over-the-shoulder observations, and countless meetings. The results are one-time snapshots of limited accuracy that take months to produce, and then are quickly out of date.

At Zeitworks, we use automated data collection and Machine Learning to automatically discover, analyze and improve an organization's business processes with zero disruption, and provide business leaders with business insights in near real-time. Our disruptive technology and SaaS delivery model allow us to democratize process improvement by taking it directly to the leaders and team members that perform the work. With Zeitworks, companies can make improvements to upgrade their efficiency and their customer experience.

Roles & Responsibilities

Qualifications

ZEITWORKS TEAM VALUES

Continuous improvement; whether it's our customers or our team, we strive to help everyone to reach their full potential both individually and organizationally. We make every decision and measure every outcome based on how well it serves our customers and builds their trust.

Empowerment comes by showing people how their actions directly impact the businesses' goals, helping them to focus on what matters the most. We balance autonomy with accountability and risk with credibility. We develop leaders who can determine how to best increase our value to our customers and the company.

Speed matters but it requires a well informed team, a plan, and measurable outcomes. Some mistakes will be made along the way but that's good; it means decisions are being made. Even if things don't go as planned, it's an opportunity to share and to learn.

Integrity based on honesty, transparency and follow through, with no politics, hidden agendas or passive-aggressive behavior, builds trust. We share an obligation to respectfully put forth challenges when we disagree or see a problem; holding each other accountable ensures our collective success.

Diversity in who we are, our experiences, and our opinions, enables us to find creative and innovative solutions to challenging problems. We strive to create a culture based on humility and respect to ensure everyone can thrive.
